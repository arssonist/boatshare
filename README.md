<h2>Welcome to Gilligan! This is ride-sharing app for boats. Boat lovers can book a ride and boat owners can request a crew<h2>

<h4>An application created as a final project for Bitmaker Web Dev Bootcamp</h4>

This is an app based on the concept of the sharing economy. It allows both boat owners and sailors without their own boats to connect.

The homepage displays a list of all the trips currently scheduled to take place. In order to create a new trip, or a "voyage" as we call it, one must first create an account. 

Once completed the user will then have the ability to create both a voyage on which they could recruite crew members, as well as  book passage as a crew member on other voyages. At this time there is no monetary element.

This application is built using Ruby on Rails. Highlights inlude the use of important gems such as Sorcery and Figaro as well as the inclusion of the Google Maps API. 

Future Nice to Haves would include an API for weather, social media feeds, a more user friendly homepage, and the ability charge money for rides via Stripe.
